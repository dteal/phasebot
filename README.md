# phasebot

This code attempts to use a microphone phase array for sound-based indoor localization, particularly for robotics. 

Code is organized as follows:

* receiver_python: direction-finding code using desktop Python for testing
* receiver_snapdragon: direction-finding code for Snapdragon-based Qualcomm 410C Dragonboard (interfaces with RedBot)
* robot: code for a SparkFun RedBot robot platform for proof-of-concept robotics applications (controlled by Snapdragon)
* transmitter: code for an audio signal transmitter

This code was written for HackTX 2018.
